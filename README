DESCRIPTION
    PadWalker is a module which allows you to inspect (and even change!)
    lexical variables in any subroutine which called you. It will only show
    those variable which are in-scope at the point of the call.

    The `peek_my' routine takes one parameter, the number of call levels to
    go back. (It works the same way as caller() does.) It returns a
    reference to a hash which associates each variable name with a reference
    to its value. The variable names include the prefix, so $x is actually
    '$x'.

    For example:
        my $x = 12;
        my $h = peek_my (0);
        ${$h->{'$x'}}++;
        print $x;  # prints 13

    Or a more complex example:

      sub increment_my_x {
        my $h = peek_my (1);
        ${$h->{'$x'}}++;
      }

      my $x=5;
      increment_my_x;
      print $x;  # prints 6
