	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

Revision history between 0.01 and 0.03 has been lost in the mists
of time. Sorry about that.

0.03 was the first public release.

0.04  Thu Jul 19 13:50:19 BST 2001
	- Applied patch from Richard Soderberg to let it compile
	  under ithreads

0.05  Thu Jan 10 21:12:10 GMT 2002
	- Experimental peek_sub routine

0.06  Wed Mar  6 22:16:13 GMT 2002
	- Proper test script
	- Two bug fixes

0.07  Thu Mar 14 19:56:29 GMT 2002
	- Clean up POD documentation
	- Behave properly with debugger
	- Work under Perl 5.005

0.08  Mon Mar 18 17:54:16 GMT 2002
	- _upcontext() XSUB, for Richard Clamp
	- work properly with recursion
	- see past eval

0.09  Wed May 21 17:24:32 BST 2003
        - compile on threaded builds
        - skip test 9 if we're on Perl 5.8. (Otherwise it fails.)

0.10  Wed Jul 30 18:40:03 BST 2003
	- accommodate the new versions of perl (5.8.1)
	- acknowledge that test 9 fails because nested eval handling
          is simply broken. (Fix in a future release.)
